Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning 🏥🔬
🚀 A project focused on exploring and analyzing the Disease Prediction Dataset using Python. It includes dataset exploration, data visualization, and optional exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into disease-related patterns.

📌 Project Description
This project aims to analyze and visualize the dataset to understand relationships between features and predict diseases using machine learning techniques. The key tasks include:
✅ Dataset Exploration (Loading, Cleaning, Descriptive Statistics)
✅ Data Visualization (Histograms, Scatter Plots, Box Plots)
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Optional

🎯 Task Breakdown
1️⃣ Dataset Exploration
Load the dataset using pandas.
Check for missing values and handle them accordingly.
Convert data types where necessary.
Generate basic statistics: mean, median, standard deviation.
2️⃣ Data Visualization
Histograms: Understanding feature distributions.
Scatter Plots: Exploring relationships between variables.
Box Plots: Identifying outliers and variability.
3️⃣ Data Analysis (Optional)
Identify potential correlations between features.
Detect outliers and anomalies.
Make initial observations about disease trends.
📊 Key Considerations
✔ Code Clarity: Well-structured and commented code.
✔ Data Understanding: Explaining insights from data analysis.
✔ Visualization: Creating meaningful and visually appealing graphs.

🚀 Future Enhancements
🔹 Implement Machine Learning Models for disease prediction.
🔹 Improve data preprocessing techniques.
🔹 Deploy the model using Flask/Streamlit for a web interface.
